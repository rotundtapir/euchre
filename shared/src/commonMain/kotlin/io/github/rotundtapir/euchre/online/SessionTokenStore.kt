/**
 * Persistence seam for the online session token, so a brand-new app/page instance can present the
 * token in its `Hello` and resume the seat it held (see [OnlineViewModel]). The web shell backs it
 * with the tab's `sessionStorage`: a page reload — including a same-tab navigation to an invite
 * link — starts a fresh wasm instance with no memory, and this is the only thing that lets it
 * reclaim its lobby seat instead of the room seeing a stranger. Deliberately NOT shared storage:
 * two tabs presenting one token would evict each other's socket in an endless reconnect loop.
 *
 * Android keeps [None]: its ViewModel (and so the in-memory token) already survives everything
 * short of process death, and the server's session TTL makes a much-later resume moot.
