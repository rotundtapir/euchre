/**
 * Turns the server's [ViewUpdate] stream into the same paced, animated experience the local game
 * has. Incoming views are queued (never back-pressuring the socket) and released through the shared
 * [PacingGates] so deals animate and completed tricks hold exactly as in a local game — the gates
 * are predicates on a view's shape, so they work identically here.
 *
 * Pacing is entirely client-side; the server never waits for animations. A "bot beat" is inserted
 * before a view only when the *previous* view's actor was not us, mirroring how the local game paces
 * a bot's move but echoes the human's own action instantly. The first view after a (re)connection is
 * a snapshot: it bypasses the gates (there was no deal animation to wait for) and pre-acknowledges
 * the pacing signals so the subsequent live views don't stall.
