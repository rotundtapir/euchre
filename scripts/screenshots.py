"""Capture the fastlane phone screenshots reproducibly.

Adapted from 500's script of the same name. Store listings drift from the app when captures are
manual — 500 shipped three images that no longer matched its UI. The engine is strictly
seed-deterministic, so a chosen board can be re-shot identically after any UI change: this drives
the real app through the same intent-extra overrides the connected suite uses
(EXTRA_SEED / EXTRA_ANIMATION_SPEED=OFF / EXTRA_SOUND_VOLUME=0) and taps by *label*, not by
coordinate, so it survives layout tweaks.

Prerequisites:
  - an emulator at 1080x2400, ANDROID_SERIAL pointed at it. This machine allows ONE emulator at a
    time across every session, not one each — four sessions each obeying a per-session limit is how
    it ended up running three and hard-powering-off on 2026-08-25. Check first, and say so in the
    other sessions' agent-mail inboxes before and after:
      pgrep -c qemu-system-x86        # must be 0; it counts other sessions' emulators too
      pgrep -a qemu-system-x86        # says whose, if not
    Then boot euchre's own AVD (5554 is 500's by convention) inside its own cgroup scope, so a kill
    takes the emulator rather than the whole terminal session:
      systemd-run --user --scope -p MemoryHigh=3800M -- \
        $ANDROID_HOME/emulator/emulator -avd euchre_api35 -port 5556 \
        -no-window -gpu swiftshader_indirect -no-audio -no-boot-anim -no-snapshot &
      export ANDROID_SERIAL=emulator-5556
    `-no-window` matters for more than tidiness: SwiftShader still renders every frame, and an
    animating Compose screen has been measured pinning 12 host cores (qemu at 1233% CPU) on this
    box. That is a power-draw problem as much as a CPU one. It does NOT mean turning the screen
    off here — these shots need pixels — but do kill the AVD the moment the captures are done.
  - the foss debug APK installed: ./gradlew :app:installFossDebug
    (foss, not play: the play flavour renders an ad slot that must not appear in a listing image)
  - for the online shots only, a local dev server. Port 8081 is euchre's convention — 8080 is
    500's, and a server of ours there breaks their connected suite:
      DEV_MODE=true PORT=8081 ./gradlew :server:run
    then pass --server ws://10.0.2.2:8081

The 'online' shot fills the other seats with bots. For a listing shot showing a real second player
(which is what sells cross-play), run a peer web client against the same server while this script
waits in the lobby — serve web/build/dist/wasmJs/productionExecutable under a /euchre/ path and open
  /euchre/?joinCode=<code>&playerName=Robin&serverUrl=ws://localhost:8081&animationSpeed=OFF
then Join and Ready up. The peer must stay connected: once its socket drops the seat reverts to a
bot and the label picks up "(bot)".

Usage:
  scripts/screenshots.py --list
  scripts/screenshots.py home bidding tutorial
  scripts/screenshots.py --server ws://10.0.2.2:8081 lobby online
  scripts/screenshots.py --out /tmp/shots all

Output files are named <shot>.png; the mapping onto fastlane's numbered files is printed at the end
rather than applied, so replacing a listing image stays a deliberate step.
